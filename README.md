what was new to me:
-Linux terminal (as I've never worked in this system before);
-Status Codes in HTTP;
-Connection handling in HTTP;

what surprised me:
-online availability of Linux manual;
-existance of the request and response messages;
-possibility of controlling the Cachability;

what I intend to use in future:
-Git Bash;
-Extra materials for further exploring pf protocols.
